Join me on a magical forest adventure where monochrome fireflies dance on your
wrist. Normally, the fireflies swarm and blink and dance, but every minute or
so, they join together and do their best to show you the time. They hold
formation for only a moment, but the effort is to great for their little
wings. In their excitement, they all glow together in unison and then quickly
return to their natural state.
